## Larger Context

Introduced to the state by Franciscan missionaries in the late 18th century, Californian wine grapes (*Vitis vinifera*) now account for over 90% of the wine produced in the United States [@cahill2007; @alston2018]. This level of production makes California the fourth largest producer of wine in the world [@cahill2007], with 2016 production valued at $3.6 billion [@alston2018]. California wine production is divided spatially into 17 "crush" districts representing the administrative areas in which grapes were grown [@usda2019]. @alston2018 present five general groupings aggregating the crush districts; each representative of different regional terrains, growing conditions, and weather patterns. Given their unique geographic arrangement and local environments, these regions have and will continue to experience climate change in site specific ways playing out differentially across grape varietals.  

## Specific problem

The effects of climate change on many aspects California viticulture are well known. For example, @white2006 used high-resolution climate models (25 km) to show that projected increases in extreme temperatures would virtually eliminate wine production in regions only marginally well-suited for viticulture in the United States, while also creating small-scale refugia for high-quality wine production. Further, average growing season temperatures, which have increased along the Central Coast of California by 1.6 \textdegree C since 1930 [@jones2008], are major predictors of grape maturities that vary by varietal [@jones2007]. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) has also been shown to affect wine quality in California, with warm phases of the PDO bringing fewer frosts and longer growing seasons to the state [@jones2008]. While the potential outcomes of climate change on wine quality and viticulture potential have been explored, regionally and varietally specific climate pressure-response thresholds have yet to be quantified. For these thresholds, small changes in climate pressure may result in large and non-linear changes to wine quality. Further, climates conducive to viticulture within the past 30-40 years have been hypothesized to contribute to concurrent increases in wine quality, but the relative influences techonological innovation on wine quality during this time period are not fully understood.

## Hypothesis

We first hypothesize that climate pressures affect California wine quality in varietally and regionally specific ways, and that these differences result in quality thresholds with potential actionable outcomes for viticulturists. Second, we will develop a simple "efficiency" indicator to broadly characterize technological innovation in viticulture. We hypothesize that the relative influences of both technological innovation and climate on wine quality can be estimated through statistical models.
